There is still a lot to do:

To Make It Fully Work:
 * add postprocessor logic
 * add i18n

Before 0.1 Release Attempt:
 * make unittests cover 100%
 * make distutils egg
 * write installation instructions
 * doublecheck MANUAL
 * get an online presence for users (for devs github is enough)
 
Possibly After 0.1 Release, But Then As Fast As Possible:
 * write docs for developers, esp. some nice state machine graphs
 * make rpm, deb, and a windows installer
 * and I mean for each stable release
 * write man page
 * add syntax highligher to gedit/kile/...
 
Higher Goals:
 * get into official Fedora (Ubuntu, SuSE, Debian) repository
 * write a gedit extension
 * and emacs support
 * and other IDE integration
 * and whatnot
 
Always Good:
 * write more documentation
 * write more sinks
 * write more postprocessors
 * write more functions
 * code cleanups
 * check if docs are still up-to-date
 
There is a lot to do, even for non-coders. If you want to help, please write to:
