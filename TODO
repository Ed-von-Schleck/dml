There is still a lot to do:

To Make It Fully Work:
 * add postprocessor logic

Before Any Release Attempt:
 * make unittests cover 100%
 * write installation instructions
 * make distutils egg
 
Possibly After First Release, But Then As Fast As Possible:
 * write docs for developers
 * make a windows installer
 * get an online presence for users (for devs github is enough)
 
Higher Goals:
 * get into official Fedora (Ubuntu, SuSE) repository
 
Always Good:
 * write more sinks
 * write more postprocessors
 * write more functions
 * code cleanups
 * check if docs are still up-to-date
