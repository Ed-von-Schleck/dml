# This is so stupid
Lara: <being dragged away by a dragon> Help me! <off>
Ed: For great Justice!

In the dragons lair.

Bill the dragon: I will eat you, because that is what I do!
Lara: Oh please don't. # now this isn't the sharpest dialog ever, but it'll do
Bill: Sorry, it's my nature.

Bill is setting the table.

Bill: <sings> Being a dragon is great fun\\
I eat my princesses well done.

Ed: <enters the lair> Hand over that lovely lady, and/or die!
Bill: Why?
Ed: <shrugs> I don't know. Am I not supposed say so?
Bill: Who said that?
Ed: Look, can we get this over with? I didn't expect a kind of Spanish
Inquisition!
the Spanish Inquisition: <storms in> Nobody expects the Spanish
Inquisition!

ACT III
-------

Bill, the dragon lies on the floor, dead.

Lara: Thank you for rescuing me! It's OK that you took the narrativ shortcut
to fight Bill while everyone was outside downing a few beers.
Ed: Yeah, let's go home, I've got a parser to write.

Everybody happy.
